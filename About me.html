	<h3>Hello</h3>
	<p>
		my name is Ines Argueta-Ley. An adventurer at heart, I traveled far from my native country of Luxembourg to sunny California in pursuit of a career in graphic design. While there is nothing intrinsically lacking in the education offered at home, I felt my creative drive required something more than the safety of the familiar. From a tender age, drawing and painting were great passions of mine. This appreciation of thought-to-paper magic sent me on the path of architecture prior discovering the limitless possibilities of graphics. Milton Glaser was an early influence with his simple, effortless, modern style. Emulating his ease at which he connected with his audience, i strive for the same simplicity without sacrificing depth; a simple idea transcends language and culture, drawing together people around the globe to stand behind a symbol. That is the power of a graphic. The marriage of multiple mediums, styles, and ideas though this outlet provides me with endless opportunity to express my thoughts and feelings in a deep and meaningful way.
