    <p>
I am a recent college graduate (3.6 GPA, BA in Graphic Design) from Otis College of Art and Design. During the course of my academic career and after graduating, I also managed to accrue nearly 2 years of work experience. I had the privilege of working freelance for a few companies, such as Reversed Rescue in a Graphic Designer role, where I learned valuable professional skills such as corporate identity, promotions, and deadline management. In both my academic and professional life, I have been consistently praised as patient and attentive by my professors and peers. Thanks to my rich and varied experience, I am today proficient in various types of graphic designing work, including logo creation, marketing materials like flyers and social media visuals, and presets .Whether working on academic, extracurricular , or professional projects, I apply proven problem-solving, research, and creative thinking skills.
